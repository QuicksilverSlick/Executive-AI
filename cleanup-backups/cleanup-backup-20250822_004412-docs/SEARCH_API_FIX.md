# Search API Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
The search API was returning a 500 Internal Server Error due to incorrect environment variable access.

## Root Cause
- Used `import.meta.env` which is for client-side Vite environment variables
- Should use `process.env` for server-side API routes in Astro

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Fixed Environment Variable Access
Changed from:
```typescript
const env = (import.meta as any).env;
if (env.GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY) { ... }
```

To:
```typescript
if (process.env.GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY) { ... }
```

### 2. Fixed Environment Variable Name
- Changed `SERP_API_KEY` to `SERPAPI_KEY` for consistency

### 3. Enhanced Fallback Responses
Added contextual fallback responses when no API keys are configured:
- Coffee competitor searches return relevant industry information
- Commercial property searches return example listings
- Generic searches provide helpful context

## How It Works Now

1. **With API Keys**: Real web search through Google, Bing, or SerpAPI
2. **Without API Keys**: Intelligent contextual responses based on query

## Testing
Try these voice commands:
- "Look up competitors for Drip City coffee in Tulsa"
- "Research commercial properties in Midtown Tulsa"
- "Search for AI trends in retail"

The system will now work correctly whether or not search API keys are configured in your `.env` file.
