# Deployment Instructions - Windows

## The build was successful! ✅

The application built successfully with all React SSR fixes. Now we need to deploy it to Cloudflare Pages.

## Deploy from Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell

Since you're on Windows, please run these commands in **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell** (not WSL):

### Option 1: Using the Batch File

1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell
2. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```cmd
   cd C:\path\to\executive-ai-training
   ```
3. Run the deployment:
   ```cmd
   deploy-windows.bat
   ```

### Option 2: Manual Commands

1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell
2. Navigate to your project directory
3. Run these commands:
   ```cmd
   npx wrangler login
   npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name=executive-ai --branch=main
   ```

### Option 3: Use Cloudflare Dashboard

Since the build completed successfully, you can also manually upload the `dist` folder:

1. Go to your Cloudflare Pages dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Click "Upload assets" or "Create new deployment"
4. Upload the entire `dist` folder that was just created
5. This will bypass all command-line issues

## What Was Fixed

The build now includes:
- ✅ React SSR browser-compatible rendering
- ✅ MessageChannel error resolved
- ✅ All crypto modules properly externalized
- ✅ Cloudflare Workers compatibility

## Verify Success

After deployment, check:
1. No more "MessageChannel is not defined" errors
2. Site loads at your Pages URL
3. Voice agent functionality works
