# Voice Agent Critical Fixes - Production Emergency Resolved

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Voice Agent Auto-Starting ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Voice agent was automatically initializing and connecting when users landed on the page, causing unnecessary API costs and poor UX.

**Root Cause**: WebRTC agent initialization was triggered automatically in `useWebRTCVoiceAssistant` hook's `useEffect`, causing immediate connection regardless of user intent.

**Solution**: 
- Disabled automatic initialization in `useWebRTCVoiceAssistant.ts` line 127
- Added manual initialization method `initializeVoiceAgentManually()`  
- Modified `startListening()` and `sendMessage()` to trigger initialization only on first user interaction
- Set `autoStart: false` in session state configuration

**Result**: Voice agent now only connects when user explicitly clicks microphone or sends a message.

### Issue 2: Mobile Elements Not Clickable ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: On mobile, only mic icon and chat UI were clickable - all other page elements were unresponsive due to invisible overlay blocking.

**Root Cause**: Full-screen modal overlay (`inset-0` class) was blocking pointer events even when voice panel was minimized.

**Solution**:
- Updated CSS in `voice-assistant.css` with proper pointer-events handling
- Added conditional pointer-events in React component based on `isMinimized` state
- Ensured FAB button always has `pointer-events: auto`
- Prevented backdrop overlay when voice panel is minimized

**Result**: All page elements are now clickable when voice panel is minimized, with only the FAB button available for interaction.
