# Connection State Fix

## Issue
The WebRTC connection was established successfully, but the React component state remained stuck at `connectionState: 'connecting', isConnected: false`.

## Root Cause
Event name mismatch between the WebRTC agent and React hook:
- WebRTC agent emits: `connectionStateChanged` (with 'd')
- React hook listens for: `connectionStateChange` (without 'd')

Same issue with conversation state:
- WebRTC agent emits: `conversationStateChanged` (with 'd')  
- React hook listens for: `conversationStateChange` (without 'd')

## Fix Applied
Updated the event listeners in `useWebRTCVoiceAssistant.ts`:

```typescript
// Before (incorrect):
agent.on('connectionStateChange', handleConnectionStateChange);
agent.on('conversationStateChange', handleConversationStateChange);

// After (correct):
agent.on('connectionStateChanged', handleConnectionStateChange);
agent.on('conversationStateChanged', handleConversationStateChange);
```

## Testing the Fix

1. **Clear browser cache and reload**:
   ```javascript
   // In browser console
   localStorage.clear();
   sessionStorage.clear();
   location.reload();
   ```

2. **Open the voice assistant** and watch for:
   - Green connection dot appearing
   - Status changing from "Connecting..." to "Ready to assist"
   - Chat input becoming enabled

3. **Check console logs** for:
   ```
   [Hook] Connection state changed from disconnected to connected
   [Hook] Successfully connected - clearing errors and updating state
   [Hook] Connection state update complete: {
     newState: 'connected',
     isConnected: true,
     status: 'idle',
     hasPermission: true
   }
   ```

4. **Test chat input**:
   - Type a message and press Enter
   - Message should appear immediately
   - AI should respond

## What This Fixes
- ✅ Connection state properly syncs between WebRTC and React
- ✅ Chat input enables when connected
- ✅ Status text updates correctly
- ✅ Green connection indicator appears
- ✅ Error states clear on successful connection

## Debug Commands
If you still see issues after the fix:

```javascript
// Check if events are being received
window.WebRTCVoiceAgent?.listeners('connectionStateChanged')

// Force trigger a state update (for testing)
window.WebRTCVoiceAgent?.emit('connectionStateChanged', 'connected')
```
