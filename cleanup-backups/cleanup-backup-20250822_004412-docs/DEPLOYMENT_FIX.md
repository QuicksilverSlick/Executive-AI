# Fix for CSS Not Loading on Cloudflare Pages

## The Issue
The CSS files are not loading because the `_routes.json` file was excluding the `/_astro/*` directory, which contains all the CSS and JS files.

## The Solution

### 1. Fix _routes.json
The `_routes.json` file should NOT exclude the `/_astro/*` directory. I've already fixed this.

### 2. Rebuild and Deploy

```bash
# Clean build
rm -rf dist

# Build the application
npm run build

# Deploy to Pages
npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name executive-ai-training --commit-dirty=true
```

### 3. Wait for Deployment
After deployment, wait 2-3 minutes for the CDN to propagate the changes.

### 4. Clear Browser Cache
Force refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R) to clear any cached responses.

## Alternative: Direct Asset Serving

If the issue persists, you can configure Cloudflare Pages to serve assets directly by:

1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard
2. Navigate to Pages > executive-ai-training > Settings
3. Under "Build configurations", add:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Build output directory: `dist`

## Why This Happened

Cloudflare Pages uses a `_routes.json` file to determine which paths should be handled by the Worker functions and which should be served as static files. By excluding `/_astro/*`, we were telling Cloudflare to NOT serve those files at all, causing the CSS to fail to load.

## Current Status

- ✅ Environment variables configured (OPENAI_API_KEY)
- ✅ Deployment successful
- ✅ _routes.json fixed to allow asset serving
- ⏳ Waiting for CDN propagation
