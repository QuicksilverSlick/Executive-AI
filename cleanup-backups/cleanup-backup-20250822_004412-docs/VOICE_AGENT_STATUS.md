## 🐛 Debug Info

The system is working correctly in continuous mode. The main issue was UI/UX - users didn't realize it was already listening because:
- The panel was minimized
- The status wasn't clear
- There was still a microphone button suggesting push-to-talk

These have all been addressed now!
