# Hero Section and Credibility Bar Improvements

## Executive Summary
Successfully fixed spacing issues, improved gradient text legibility, and transformed the credibility bar from plain text to professional icon-based logos.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Gradient Text Improvements**
- **Enhanced Gradient**: Added a three-color gradient with via point for smoother transitions
- **Light Mode**: Navy → Navy-light → Gold gradient
- **Dark Mode**: Gold → Gold-warm → Gold for better visibility
- **Text Stroke**: Added subtle stroke (0.5px) to improve text edge definition
- **Font Weight**: Ensured gradient text is always bold for better legibility

### 2. **Spacing Fix for Cut-off Text**
- **Line Height**: Added `leading-tight` class to prevent descenders from being cut off
- **Padding**: Added `pb-2` to each headline span to ensure proper spacing
- **Margin**: Increased bottom margin from `mb-6` to `mb-8` for better separation

### 3. **Credibility Bar Transformation**
Replaced plain text company names with professional icon-based design:

#### Before:
```
QuantumLeap Capital    Summit Health Alliance    Apex Logistics
```

#### After:
```
[Icon]                [Icon]                    [Icon]
QuantumLeap Capital   Summit Health Alliance    Apex Logistics
Private Equity        Healthcare                Supply Chain
```

### Company Icons Assigned:
- **QuantumLeap Capital**: Trending-up icon (Private Equity)
- **Summit Health Alliance**: Heart-pulse icon (Healthcare)
- **Apex Logistics**: Truck icon (Supply Chain)
- **InnovateTech Solutions**: CPU icon (Technology)
- **Global Ventures Inc**: Globe icon (Consulting)

## Visual Improvements

### Icon Design
- 64x64px rounded containers with subtle backgrounds
- Hover effects with brand color transitions
- Industry type labels for context
- Smooth scale and translate animations

### Animation Updates
- Added vertical translation to the scale animation
- Full opacity (1) instead of 0.6 for better visibility
- Maintained staggered animation delays

### Dark Mode Support
- Icons adapt to dark theme colors
- Hover states use gold accents in dark mode
- Proper contrast for all text elements

## Technical Details

### CSS Changes
```css
.text-gradient {
  /* Three-point gradient for smoother transitions */
  background: linear-gradient(to right, navy, navy-light, gold);
  /* Subtle stroke for edge definition */
  -webkit-text-stroke: 0.5px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
}
```

### Component Structure
```html
<div class="group flex flex-col items-center">
  <div class="icon-container">
    <Icon name="lucide:trending-up" />
  </div>
  <div class="text-center">
    <p class="company-name">QuantumLeap Capital</p>
    <p class="industry-type">Private Equity</p>
  </div>

```
