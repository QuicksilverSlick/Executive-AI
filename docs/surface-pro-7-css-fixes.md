# Surface Pro 7 CSS Fixes Documentation

## Issue Description
On Surface Pro 7 tablet at 912x1368 resolution, several CSS styling issues were identified:
1. The "1:1 Personalized Approach" box was misaligned
2. Timeline items appeared too narrow and cramped
3. Values section cards looked squished
4. Stats section numbers and text were not properly aligned
5. Button spacing in CTA section needed adjustment

## Root Cause
The Surface Pro 7 at 912px width was falling into the general tablet breakpoint (640px-1023px) which wasn't optimized for this mid-size tablet resolution. The layout needed specific adjustments for the 900px-1024px range.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added New Breakpoint (900px-1024px)
Created a specific media query range for mid-size tablets like Surface Pro 7 in `global.css`:

```css
@media (min-width: 900px) and (max-width: 1023px) {
  /* Specific optimizations for this range */
}
```

### 2. Fixed Personalized Box Layout
- Limited max-width to 400px for better proportions
- Adjusted font size for the large "1:1" number using clamp()
- Centered the box with margin-inline: auto

### 3. Optimized Grid Layouts
- Changed two-column-modern to single column for better readability
- Made founder layout stack vertically with centered content
- Set values grid to 2 columns instead of auto-fit
- Set stats grid to 2 columns with better spacing

### 4. Improved Timeline Display
- Increased left padding to 2.5rem for better spacing
- Added more padding to timeline content boxes
- Maintained proper vertical line alignment

### 5. Enhanced Button Groups
- Set flex-direction to row for horizontal layout
- Added min-width of 180px per button
- Ensured proper touch targets (48px minimum height)

### 6. Added Container Optimizations
- Updated padding-inline with better clamp values
- Set max-width constraints for containers
- Added overflow-x: hidden to prevent horizontal scroll

### 7. CSS Containment
Added CSS containment properties for better performance:
- `.contain-layout` for layout containment
- `.contain-all` for layout and style containment

## Files Modified
1. `/src/styles/global.css` - Added Surface Pro 7 specific media query
2. `/src/styles/tablet-optimization.css` - Added mid-size tablet overrides

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test on actual Surface Pro 7 device at 912x1368 resolution
2. Check both portrait and landscape orientations
3. Verify touch targets are at least 48px in height
4. Ensure no horizontal scrolling occurs
5. Test with both light and dark themes

## Known Limitations
- @import warnings still exist but don't affect functionality
- May need further refinement for other tablets in the 900-1024px range
- Consider consolidating all CSS into global.css to avoid import issues

## Future Improvements
1. Add viewport-specific testing for common tablet sizes
2. Consider using container queries for more component-based responsive design
3. Add visual regression testing for tablet viewports
4. Implement CSS custom properties for breakpoint values
