# Case Studies Spacing Fix

## Issue
The case study cards on the case studies page were appearing too close together, making it difficult to distinguish between different case studies and creating a cramped appearance.

## Solution
Implemented proper spacing between case study cards with responsive breakpoints:

### Spacing Implementation
1. **Wrapper Container**: Added a `space-y-{size}` utility wrapper around all case studies
   - Mobile (<640px): 48px spacing (`space-y-12`)
   - Small tablets (640px+): 64px spacing (`space-y-16`)
   - Medium tablets (768px+): 80px spacing (`space-y-20`)
   - Large screens (1024px+): 96px spacing (`space-y-24`)

2. **Visual Separator**: Added subtle divider lines between case studies
   - Positioned absolutely between cards
   - Gradient line for subtle visual separation
   - Responsive sizing:
     - Mobile: 16px wide, 24px above card
     - Small tablets: 20px wide, 32px above card
     - Medium tablets: 24px wide, 40px above card
     - Large screens: 24px wide, 48px above card

3. **Hover Effect**: Added shadow transition on hover
   - From `shadow-xl` to `shadow-2xl`
   - 300ms transition for smooth effect
   - Helps indicate interactivity

### Code Changes
- Modified `/src/pages/case-studies.astro`
- Wrapped case studies in a div with responsive spacing classes
- Added conditional separator line (only shows between cards, not before first card)
- Fixed HTML structure (missing closing div)

### Visual Improvements
- Clear separation between case studies
- Better visual hierarchy
- Improved readability on all devices
- Professional appearance with subtle design touches

## Testing
- Tested on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
- Verified proper spacing scales with screen size
- Confirmed separators appear correctly in both light and dark modes
- Build completes successfully without errors
