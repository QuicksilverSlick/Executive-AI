## Overview

This document outlines comprehensive test scenarios for validating the voice search acknowledgment system. Each scenario includes specific test inputs, expected behaviors, and validation criteria to ensure a seamless voice search experience.

## Core Requirements

- **Voice Consistency**: Same voice used throughout the entire interaction
- **Acknowledgment First**: Agent must acknowledge search requests before executing search functions
- **Natural Flow**: Smooth transition from acknowledgment to search execution to results
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of failures while maintaining voice consistency
- **No Manual TTS**: All responses should use the agent's natural voice, not separate TTS calls

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Simple Search Scenarios

#### 1.1 Weather Query
**Input**: "What's the weather?"

**Expected Flow**:
1. **User Input**: "What's the weather?"
2. **Agent Acknowledgment**: "I'll check the weather for you" (using agent's voice)
3. **Function Call**: `get_weather()` executed
4. **Results**: Weather information presented conversationally

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Acknowledgment occurs before function execution
- [ ] Same voice used for acknowledgment and results
- [ ] Response time < 2 seconds for acknowledgment
- [ ] No awkward pauses or voice changes
- [ ] Natural conversational flow

**Test Implementation**:
```javascript
await testVoiceSearch("What's the weather?", {
  expectedAcknowledment: true,
  expectedFunction: "get_weather",
  maxAcknowledmentTime: 2000,
  validateVoiceConsistency: true
});
```

#### 1.2 Simple Web Search
**Input**: "Search for pizza recipes"

**Expected Flow**:
1. **User Input**: "Search for pizza recipes"
2. **Agent Acknowledgment**: "Let me search for that information" (using agent's voice)
3. **Function Call**: `search_web(query: "pizza recipes")` executed
4. **Results**: Search results presented conversationally

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Acknowledgment uses natural language

2. **Agent Acknowledgment**: "I'll check the weather and search for nearby restaurants for you" (agent's voice)
3. **Function Call 1**: `get_weather()` executed
4. **Function Call 2**: `search_web(query: "nearby restaurants")` executed
5. **Results**: Both weather and restaurant information presented

**Validation Criteria**:

- [ ] Both functions executed in logical order
- [ ] Results clearly separated but conversational
- [ ] Voice consistency maintained throughout

### 3. Sequential Search Scenarios

#### 3.1 Follow-up Search
**Initial Query**: "What's the weather?"
**Follow-up Query**: "Search for restaurants nearby"

**Expected Flow**:
1. **First Interaction**: Complete weather search with acknowledgment
2. **Second Query**: "Search for restaurants nearby"
3. **Second Acknowledgment**: "Now let me search for restaurants nearby" (same voice)
4. **Function Call**: `search_web(query: "restaurants nearby")` executed
5. **Results**: Restaurant information presented

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Both interactions have proper acknowledgments
- [ ] Same voice used across both interactions
- [ ] Context awareness in second acknowledgment
- [ ] No voice drift between interactions

#### 3.2 Rapid Sequential Searches
**Queries**: 
1. "Weather forecast"
2. "News headlines"
3. "Stock prices"

**Expected Flow**:
- Each query gets individual acknowledgment
- Functions executed in sequence
- Results presented with consistent voice
- No confusion between queries

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Three separate acknowledgments
- [ ] Correct function calls for each query
- [ ] Voice consistency across all three interactions
- [ ] Proper separation of results

### 4. Error Case Scenarios

#### 4.1 Network Failure
**Input**: "Search for current news"
**Simulated Error**: Network timeout during search execution

**Expected Flow**:
1. **User Input**: "Search for current news"
2. **Agent Acknowledgment**: "I'll search for current news for you" (agent's voice)
3. **Function Call**: `search_web()` attempted
4. **Error Occurs**: Network timeout
5. **Error Response**: "I'm sorry, I'm having trouble accessing the internet right now. Please try again in a moment." (same voice)

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Acknowledgment occurs normally
- [ ] Error explained clearly in agent's voice
- [ ] No voice switching during error handling
- [ ] Graceful degradation of experience

#### 4.2 API Rate Limiting
**Input**: "Find information about AI trends"
**Simulated Error**: API rate limit exceeded

**Expected Flow**:
1. **User Input**: "Find information about AI trends"
2. **Agent Acknowledgment**: "Let me search for AI trends information" (agent's voice)
3. **Function Call**: `search_web()` attempted
4. **Rate Limit Error**: API returns 429 status
5. **Error Response**: "I've reached my search limit for now. Could you try again in a few minutes?" (same voice)

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Professional error handling
- [ ] Clear explanation of temporary limitation
- [ ] Voice consistency maintained

## Manual Testing Checklist

### Pre-Test Setup
- [ ] Voice agent connected and responsive
- [ ] Audio input/output functioning
- [ ] Network connection stable
- [ ] Test scenarios prepared

### During Testing
- [ ] Monitor event flow in debug panel
- [ ] Validate acknowledgment timing
- [ ] Check voice consistency indicators
- [ ] Note any unusual behaviors

### Post-Test Validation
- [ ] Review event logs for completeness
- [ ] Analyze performance metrics
- [ ] Verify validation checklist items
- [ ] Document any issues found

## Expected Behaviors Summary

### What Should Happen
1. **Immediate Acknowledgment**: Every search request acknowledged verbally
2. **Consistent Voice**: Same voice throughout entire interaction
3. **Natural Flow**: Smooth transitions without awkward pauses
4. **Proper Sequencing**: Acknowledgment always before function execution
5. **Error Grace**: Errors handled without breaking voice consistency

### What Should NOT Happen
1. **Silent Execution**: Functions called without acknowledgment
2. **Voice Switching**: Different voices or TTS systems used
3. **Awkward Pauses**: Long delays between acknowledgment and results
4. **System Errors**: Raw error messages exposed to user
5. **Context Loss**: Confusion between sequential searches

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues
- **No Acknowledgment**: Check system prompt configuration
- **Voice Inconsistency**: Verify voice parameter settings
- **Delayed Response**: Monitor network and API performance
- **Error Exposure**: Review error handling implementation

### Debug Steps
1. Enable verbose logging in test interface
2. Monitor WebRTC connection status
3. Check API response codes and timing
4. Validate voice agent configuration
5. Review event flow sequence
