# Headshot Optimization for About Page

## Issue
The original headshot implementation had aspect ratio problems:
- Image was stretched horizontally in a grid layout
- Took up too much width and not enough height
- Didn't maintain the professional appearance of the portrait

## Solution
Redesigned the Founder section with a more effective layout:

### New Layout Structure
1. **Flex Layout**: Changed from grid to flexbox for better control
   - Mobile: Column layout with image on top
   - Desktop: Row layout with image on left, content on right

2. **Fixed Dimensions**: Set specific width and height for the image
   - Mobile: 288px × 320px (w-72 × h-80)
   - Desktop: 320px × 384px (w-80 × h-96)
   - Maintains portrait aspect ratio

3. **Visual Enhancements**:
   - Added gradient background blur effect behind image
   - Rounded corners (rounded-xl)
   - Deep shadow (shadow-2xl) for depth
   - Proper object-fit settings (object-cover object-center)

### Key Improvements
- **Aspect Ratio**: Fixed dimensions ensure the headshot maintains its natural portrait ratio
- **Professional Appearance**: The image is now properly sized and prominently displayed
- **Visual Interest**: Background gradient effect adds sophistication
- **Responsive Design**: Different sizes for mobile vs desktop ensure optimal viewing
- **Better Spacing**: Increased gap between image and content (gap-12)
- **Centered Layout**: Content properly centers on all screen sizes

### Technical Details
```css
/* Image container with gradient background */
.relative w-72 h-80 lg:w-80 lg:h-96 object-cover object-center rounded-xl shadow-2xl

/* Background accent effect */
.absolute -inset-4 bg-gradient-to-br from-brand-gold/20 to-brand-navy/20 rounded-2xl blur-xl
```

### Layout Benefits
- Image no longer stretched or distorted
- Professional portrait presentation
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Better use of whitespace
- Enhanced brand perception

## Result
The headshot now appears with proper proportions, creating a more professional and trustworthy appearance that aligns with the executive audience expectations.
