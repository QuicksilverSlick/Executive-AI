# WebRTC Session Resumption Testing Guide

## Implementation Complete ✅

We've implemented proper WebRTC session resumption following OpenAI's Realtime API best practices. The system now properly restores conversation history when reconnecting.

---

## How It Works

### Previous Implementation (Not Working)
- ❌ Saved messages to storage but created completely new sessions
- ❌ No conversation context passed to new session
- ❌ AI had no knowledge of previous interactions

### New Implementation (Working)
- ✅ Creates new session (required - sessions are ephemeral)
- ✅ Injects previous conversation history after connection
- ✅ Uses `conversation.item.create` events to restore context
- ✅ AI understands it's a continuation, not a new conversation

## Architecture

```javascript
// Session Restoration Flow
1. Page Load/Navigation
   ↓
2. Check for existing session in storage
   ↓
3. If found: Restore token and messages
   ↓
4. Establish new WebRTC connection
   ↓
5. Wait for 'session.created' event
   ↓
6. Inject conversation history chronologically
   ↓
7. Send system message about restoration
   ↓
8. Ready for continuation
```

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Basic Session Restoration

1. **Start Fresh Session**
   - Open http://localhost:4322
   - Click voice assistant button
   - Say: "Hello, my name is John and I'm interested in AI training"
   - Wait for response

2. **Refresh Page (F5)**
   - Press F5 to refresh
   - Open voice assistant again
   - Notice: "Reconnecting to previous session..."
   - Say: "What was my name again?"
   - **Expected**: AI should remember your name is John

### Test 2: Navigation Persistence

1. **Start on Homepage**
   - Open voice assistant
   - Say: "I'm looking for information about executive training"
   - Get response

2. **Navigate to Services Page**
   - Click Services in navigation
   - Open voice assistant
   - Say: "Tell me more about what we were discussing"
   - **Expected**: AI continues conversation about executive training

### Test 3: Complex Context Restoration

1. **Build Context**
   - Say: "I work at Microsoft"
   - Wait for response
   - Say: "We have 500 employees"
   - Wait for response
   - Say: "We need AI training"
   - Wait for response

2. **Refresh and Test Context**
   - Press F5
   - Open voice assistant
   - Say: "How many employees did I mention?"
   - **Expected**: AI should remember "500 employees"
   - Say: "What company do I work for?"
   - **Expected**: AI should remember "Microsoft"

### Test 4: Search Context Restoration

1. **Perform Search**
   - Say: "Search for coffee shops in Tulsa"
   - Wait for search results

2. **Refresh and Follow Up**
   - Press F5
   - Open voice assistant
   - Say: "What were their hours?" (referring to coffee shops)
   - **Expected**: AI understands context and searches for hours

## What to Look For

### Success Indicators
- ✅ "Reconnecting to previous session..." message appears
- ✅ Previous conversation context is maintained
- ✅ Follow-up questions work without re-explaining context
- ✅ AI acknowledges it's continuing a conversation

### Console Messages (DevTools)
```javascript
// Successful restoration shows:
"[WebRTCVoiceAgent] Restoring session from storage"
"[WebRTCVoiceAgent] Session restoration initiated with X messages"
"[WebRTCVoiceAgent] Waiting for session creation before injecting history"
"[WebRTCVoiceAgent] Injecting conversation history (X messages)"
"[WebRTCVoiceAgent] History injection completed successfully"
```

---

## Technical Details

### Message Injection Format
```javascript
{
  type: 'conversation.item.create',
  item: {
    type: 'message',
    role: 'user' | 'assistant',
    content: [{
      type: 'input_text' | 'text',
      text: 'message content'
    }]
  }
}
```

### Session Lifecycle Events
- `session.created` - Triggers history injection
- `conversation.item.created` - Confirms each message injected
- `error` - Handles injection failures gracefully

### Storage Locations
- **Token**: sessionStorage (tab-specific)
- **Messages**: IndexedDB (encrypted)
- **Session ID**: sessionStorage
- **Preferences**: localStorage

---

## Troubleshooting

### Session Not Restoring?
1. Check DevTools Console for errors
2. Verify sessionStorage has `voiceAgent_token`
3. Check Network tab for WebRTC connection
4. Ensure cookies/storage not blocked

### Context Not Maintained?
1. Verify messages in IndexedDB
2. Check injection completion in console
3. Ensure sufficient delay between messages
4. Verify message format is correct

### Widget Not Appearing?
1. Check for React hydration errors
2. Verify component mounting properly
3. Check browser compatibility
4. Clear cache and reload

---

## Performance Notes

- **Injection Delay**: 100ms between messages (prevents overwhelming)
- **Max History**: 20 messages (configurable)
- **Storage Cleanup**: 7 days automatic
- **Token Refresh**: Before 1-minute expiry

---

## Security Considerations

- ✅ No API keys stored client-side
- ✅ Ephemeral tokens only (60-second validity)
- ✅ AES-256-GCM encryption for messages
- ✅ Tab-specific session isolation
- ✅ Automatic cleanup on tab close

---

## Success Metrics

The implementation is working correctly if:
1. **90%+ session restoration success rate**
2. **Context maintained across all navigations**
3. **Follow-up questions work reliably**
4. **No React hydration errors**
5. **Smooth user experience with clear feedback**

---

## Next Steps

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check browser console for detailed logs
2. Verify all services are running (dev server, search server)
3. Test in incognito mode to rule out cache issues
4. Report specific error messages for debugging
