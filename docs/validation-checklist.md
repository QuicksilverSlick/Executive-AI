## Pre-Test Validation

### System Configuration
- [ ] **Voice Agent Connected**: WebRTC connection established successfully
- [ ] **Audio Input Working**: Microphone input detected and functioning
- [ ] **Audio Output Working**: Speaker output clear and audible  
- [ ] **Network Connectivity**: Stable internet connection for API calls
- [ ] **API Keys Valid**: Search APIs accessible and responding
- [ ] **Debug Panel Active**: Event logging and monitoring enabled

### Configuration Validation
- [ ] **System Prompt Includes Acknowledgment Rules**: Prompt explicitly requires verbal acknowledgment before function execution
- [ ] **Function Descriptions Updated**: Search functions include acknowledgment instructions
- [ ] **Voice Parameters Set**: Consistent voice model and voice ID configured
- [ ] **Error Handling Configured**: Graceful error responses with voice consistency
- [ ] **Timeout Settings Appropriate**: Reasonable timeouts for acknowledgment and search execution

## Core Functionality Tests

### 1. Agent Acknowledges Search Request
**Test Scenarios**: Simple weather query, web search, complex information request

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] **Acknowledgment Occurs**: Agent provides verbal acknowledgment for every search request
- [ ] **Acknowledgment Before Execution**: Verbal response occurs before function call
- [ ] **Natural Language Used**: Acknowledgment sounds conversational and appropriate
- [ ] **Query Understanding**: Acknowledgment reflects understanding of the request
- [ ] **Timing Appropriate**: Acknowledgment delivered within 2 seconds of request

**Evidence Required**:
- Event log showing acknowledgment event before search_start event
- Audio recording of acknowledgment phrase
- Timestamp validation showing proper sequence

### 2. Same Voice Used Throughout
**Test Scenarios**: Single search, multiple sequential searches, error scenarios

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] **Consistent Voice ID**: Same voice identifier used for all responses
- [ ] **No Voice Parameter Changes**: Voice settings remain constant throughout interaction
- [ ] **Audio Consistency**: Similar pitch, tone, and speaking characteristics
- [ ] **No TTS Switching**: No switching to different text-to-speech systems
- [ ] **Cross-Session Consistency**: Same voice maintained across different test sessions

**Evidence Required**:
- Voice ID tracking logs showing consistent identifier
- Audio spectral analysis showing similar characteristics
- Debug panel confirmation of voice parameters

### 3. No Manual TTS or Different Voices
**Test Scenarios**: All search types, error conditions, follow-up questions

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] **Single Voice Source**: All responses from agent's natural voice
- [ ] **No External TTS**: No separate text-to-speech calls detected
- [ ] **No Voice Mixing**: No mixing of different voice models or systems
- [ ] **API Call Validation**: Only expected API calls made (search, not TTS)
- [ ] **Consistent Audio Pipeline**: Same audio processing throughout

**Evidence Required**:
- Network monitoring showing no unexpected TTS API calls
- Audio analysis confirming single voice source
- System logs showing consistent audio pipeline usage

### 4. Smooth Transition from Acknowledgment to Results
**Test Scenarios**: Various search types, different query complexities

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] **No Awkward Pauses**: Natural timing between acknowledgment and results
- [ ] **Conversational Flow**: Results presentation feels like continuation of acknowledgment
- [ ] **Context Maintained**: Results reference the acknowledged request appropriately
- [ ] **Natural Pacing**: Appropriate speaking rhythm maintained throughout
- [ ] **Seamless Experience**: User perceives single, coherent response

**Evidence Required**:
- Timing analysis showing appropriate gaps (< 500ms ideal)
- User experience feedback confirming natural flow
- Audio analysis showing consistent pacing

### 5. Error Cases Handled Gracefully
**Test Scenarios**: Network failures, API rate limits, invalid queries, service outages

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] **Acknowledgment Still Provided**: Search acknowledgment occurs even before errors
- [ ] **Voice Consistency in Errors**: Error messages use same voice as acknowledgments
- [ ] **Clear Error Communication**: Errors explained clearly without technical jargon
- [ ] **Helpful Guidance**: Users given actionable next steps when possible
- [ ] **No System Crashes**: Errors don't break the conversation flow

**Evidence Required**:
- Error logs showing graceful handling
- Audio recordings of error responses
- Confirmation of voice consistency during errors

## Performance Validation

### Response Time Benchmarks
- [ ] **Acknowledgment Time**: < 2 seconds from end of user query
- [ ] **Search Execution Time**: < 5 seconds for typical search
- [ ] **Error Response Time**: < 3 seconds for error acknowledgment
- [ ] **Total Interaction Time**: < 10 seconds for complete search interaction
- [ ] **Consistency Across Tests**: Performance remains stable across multiple tests

### Quality Metrics
- [ ] **Voice Consistency Score**: > 95% similarity across all responses
- [ ] **Acknowledgment Accuracy**: 100% of searches acknowledged
- [ ] **Error Handling Rate**: 100% of errors handled gracefully
- [ ] **Function Call Success**: Acknowledgment precedes execution in 100% of cases
- [ ] **User Experience Score**: Subjective rating > 4.5/5 for naturalness

## Advanced Validation

### Sequential Search Testing
- [ ] **Multiple Search Handling**: Consecutive searches properly acknowledged
- [ ] **Context Awareness**: Later acknowledgments show awareness of conversation
- [ ] **Voice Consistency Maintained**: Same voice used across all searches in session
- [ ] **No Confusion**: Each search clearly distinguished and handled
- [ ] **Performance Stability**: Response times consistent across multiple searches

### Edge Case Testing
- [ ] **Rapid Fire Searches**: Quick consecutive queries handled properly
- [ ] **Interrupted Searches**: Handling of user interruptions during acknowledgment
- [ ] **Complex Multi-part Queries**: Single acknowledgment covers multiple search requests
- [ ] **Ambiguous Queries**: Appropriate acknowledgment for unclear search requests
- [ ] **Long Query Handling**: Acknowledgments for very long or complex search queries

### Integration Testing
- [ ] **WebRTC Stability**: Voice connection remains stable throughout testing
- [ ] **API Integration**: All search APIs respond correctly to function calls
- [ ] **Error Recovery**: System recovers properly from temporary failures
- [ ] **Session Persistence**: Voice consistency maintained across connection issues
- [ ] **Browser Compatibility**: Testing works across different browsers
