# SSR Fix Summary for WebRTC Voice Assistant

## Problem
The voice assistant component was throwing a `ReferenceError: document is not defined` error during server-side rendering (SSR) in Astro. This was happening because the component was trying to access `document.documentElement.classList.contains('dark')` during the initial render, which isn't available on the server.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. SSR-Safe Dark Mode Detection
Changed from:
```tsx
const isDarkMode = theme === 'dark' || (theme === 'auto' && document.documentElement.classList.contains('dark'));
```

To:
```tsx
const [isDarkMode, setIsDarkMode] = useState(theme === 'dark');

useEffect(() => {
  if (theme === 'auto' && typeof document !== 'undefined') {
    setIsDarkMode(document.documentElement.classList.contains('dark'));
    
    // Watch for theme changes
    const observer = new MutationObserver((mutations) => {
      mutations.forEach((mutation) => {
        if (mutation.type === 'attributes' && mutation.attributeName === 'class') {
          setIsDarkMode(document.documentElement.classList.contains('dark'));
        }
      });
    });
    
    observer.observe(document.documentElement, {
      attributes: true,
      attributeFilter: ['class']
    });
    
    return () => observer.disconnect();
  }
}, [theme]);
```

This approach:
- Uses React state to manage dark mode
- Only accesses `document` inside a `useEffect` (which doesn't run during SSR)
- Includes proper type checking with `typeof document !== 'undefined'`
- Adds a MutationObserver to watch for theme changes dynamically

### 2. Astro Component Updated to Use `client:only`
Changed the WebRTCVoiceWidget.astro from:
```astro
<WebRTCVoiceAssistant
  client:load
  ...props
/>
```

To:
```astro
<WebRTCVoiceAssistant
  client:only="react"
  ...props
/>
```

This ensures the component only renders on the client side, completely avoiding SSR issues.

### 3. Created SSR-Safe Wrapper
Added `WebRTCVoiceAssistantWrapper.tsx` as an additional safety layer that can be used if needed.

### 4. Updated Exports
Added the wrapper and WebRTC hook to the main index.ts exports for easier importing.

## Testing
You can verify the fixes work by:

1. **Build Test**: Run `npm run build` - it should complete without errors
2. **Dev Test**: Run `npm run dev` - the voice assistant should appear and function correctly
3. **Theme Test**: Toggle between light/dark modes - the voice assistant should update its colors accordingly

## Additional Improvements Made

### Dark Theme Colors (Matching Design System)
- Background: `#111418` (dark-surface)
- Borders: `#D4A034` (dark-gold) with 30% opacity
- Text: Uses proper hierarchy from dark theme palette
- Glass effect: Reduced to `backdrop-blur-sm` (4px) for performance

### Connection State Debugging
- Added comprehensive logging for connection states
- Better error handling and user feedback
- Debug override available: `window.DEBUG_VOICE_AGENT_FORCE_CONNECTED = true`

### Text Input Fixes
- Properly bound Enter key handler
- Connection state validation before sending
- Clear visual feedback for different states

## Best Practices Applied

1. **Always check for browser APIs** before using them: `typeof document !== 'undefined'`
2. **Use React hooks** for client-side logic that shouldn't run during SSR
3. **Use `client:only` directive** for components that heavily rely on browser APIs
4. **Provide fallback values** for SSR (e.g., default dark mode state)
5. **Add proper error boundaries** and graceful degradation

The voice assistant is now fully SSR-safe and should work correctly in all Astro rendering modes!
