// Conversation prompts and responses

  greeting: `Hello! I'm Russell Deming's AI assistant. I help executives understand how AI can transform their business and drive real ROI. 

I have complete knowledge of our executive AI training programs, Russell's background, our success stories, and available resources. 

How can I help you explore AI opportunities for your business today?`,

  serviceInquiry: `I'd be happy to tell you about our executive AI programs. We offer several options depending on your needs and timeline:

ðŸŽ¯ **15-Minute Discovery Call** (Complimentary)
A strategic consultation to assess your AI readiness and identify high-impact opportunities.

ðŸš€ **Executive AI Masterclass** (Starting at $15,000)
Transform from overwhelmed observer to Master of Synthetic Intelligenceâ„¢ with our comprehensive training program.

ðŸ“Š **AI Opportunity Audit** (Complimentary)
A quick 2-minute assessment to identify your #1 AI opportunity.

Which of these interests you most, or would you like me to recommend the best starting point based on your situation?`,

  schedulingFlow: `Perfect! I can help you schedule a 15-minute discovery call with Russell. This complimentary session will give you:

âœ… A quick assessment of your AI readiness and maturity level
âœ… 2-3 specific recommendations tailored to your situation  
âœ… Clear next steps for AI implementation in your business
âœ… Understanding of potential ROI and realistic timelines

The call is designed for busy executives - we'll pack maximum value into those 15 minutes.

Would you prefer a morning, afternoon, or evening slot? And what timezone are you in?`,

  qualificationQuestions: [
    "What's your role in the company? This helps me understand your decision-making authority and perspective.",
    "What industry are you in? This helps me share relevant examples and benchmarks.",
    "What's driving your interest in AI right now? Is it competitive pressure, efficiency needs, or growth opportunities?",
    "Have you started any AI initiatives yet? I'd love to understand your current AI maturity level.",
    "What's your biggest concern about AI implementation? Common concerns include ROI uncertainty, team readiness, or technical complexity."
  ],

  objectionHandling: {
    cost: `I understand cost is always a consideration for executive training. Here's how our clients typically think about the investment:

The average Fortune 500 company spends $12.8 million on failed AI pilots. Our $15,000 investment helps you avoid those costly mistakes while accelerating successful implementation.

Most clients see ROI within 90 days through improved decision-making, better vendor selection, and more effective team alignment. Would you like me to share some specific ROI examples from companies in your industry?`,

    time: `I know your time is incredibly valuable. That's why our program is designed specifically for busy executives:

- **3-day intensive option**: Get everything you need in concentrated sessions
- **6-week program**: Spread learning across manageable time blocks  
- **Just-in-time delivery**: Focused on immediate application, not academic theory

Most participants say it's the best ROI on their time because every hour directly translates to better AI decisions. Which format sounds more feasible for your schedule?`,

    readiness: `It's smart to question readiness - that shows good executive judgment. Here's what I've learned from working with 100+ executives:

You don't need to be technical to lead AI successfully. In fact, the most successful AI implementations are led by business-focused executives who understand strategy and ROI.

The biggest risk isn't lack of technical knowledge - it's waiting too long while competitors gain advantage. Would you like to take our quick AI readiness assessment to see exactly where you stand?`
  },

  caseStudyPrompts: {
    manufacturing: `Let me share a relevant example from our manufacturing clients:

One of our clients, a major manufacturing company, came to us completely overwhelmed by AI. They had scattered pilot projects with no clear strategy or ROI.

After our 6-week executive program, they deployed a comprehensive AI strategy that put them 2 years ahead of their competition. Their CTO told us: "Russell doesn't just teach; he delivers a decisive edge."

The key was focusing on business outcomes first, then building the technical implementation around those goals. Is this kind of strategic clarity what you're looking for?`,

    financial: `Here's a great example from financial services:

A regional financial firm was being disrupted by AI-powered fintech competitors. They needed to transform but were concerned about regulatory compliance and customer trust.

Through our executive training, they developed an AI strategy that improved customer satisfaction by 40% while maintaining full regulatory compliance. Their CEO said we helped them "transform from AI skeptics to AI leaders."

The framework we developed helped them see AI as a competitive advantage rather than a compliance risk. Does this resonate with challenges you're facing?`,

    healthcare: `I have a compelling healthcare example:

A large health system wanted to improve patient outcomes while managing costs. They were overwhelmed by AI vendor promises and unsure about HIPAA compliance.

Our AI strategy program helped them reduce patient wait times by 25% and improve diagnostic accuracy, all while maintaining strict compliance. Their Chief Medical Officer said our guidance "transformed patient care while maintaining commitment to privacy and ethics."

The key was building AI governance into the strategy from day one. Is patient outcome improvement something you're focused on?`
