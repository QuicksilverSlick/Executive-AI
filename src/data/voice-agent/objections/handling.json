      "objection": "The cost seems high / Budget constraints / Need to justify the investment",
      
      "primary": "I understand cost is always a consideration for executive training, and you're right to evaluate the investment carefully. Here's how our clients typically think about it:\n\nThe average Fortune 500 company spends $12.8 million on failed AI pilots. Our $15,000 investment helps you avoid those costly mistakes while accelerating successful implementation.\n\nMost clients see ROI within 90 days through improved decision-making, better vendor selection, and more effective team alignment.\n\nWould you like me to share some specific ROI examples from companies in your industry?",

      "detailed": {
        "roiFramework": "Let me break down the ROI framework that most executives use to justify this investment:\n\n**Cost Avoidance:**\n• Average failed AI pilot: $500K - $2M\n• Poor vendor selection: $1M - $5M\n• Delayed implementation: $100K - $500K per quarter\n\n**Accelerated Benefits:**\n• Faster strategic clarity: 6 weeks vs 6-12 months\n• Better implementation success: 95% vs industry average 30%\n• Competitive advantage: 2+ year head start\n\nThe $15,000 investment typically pays for itself by avoiding just one poorly planned AI initiative.",

        "budgetJustification": "Most executives find the budget justification straightforward when they frame it as strategic insurance:\n\n• **Risk Mitigation**: Avoid costly AI failures\n• **Acceleration**: Compress 18 months of learning into 6 weeks\n• **Competitive Advantage**: Gain 2+ year market lead\n• **Team Alignment**: Unite leadership around clear strategy\n\nMany clients use their existing training budget or allocate it from digital transformation funds. Would either of those work for your situation?",

        "paymentOptions": "We understand budget timing can be challenging. We offer several options:\n\n• **Payment plans** for qualified organizations\n• **Enterprise pricing** for multiple executives\n• **Quarterly budget allocation** options\n• **ROI guarantee** - if you don't see measurable value, we'll work with you until you do\n\nWhat would make this most feasible for your organization?"

        "You're absolutely right to consider the investment carefully - that shows good executive judgment. The way I think about it: this $15,000 investment helps you avoid the $12.8M average cost of failed AI pilots. It's really risk mitigation disguised as training.",

        "I appreciate you being direct about budget concerns. Most Fortune 500 CTOs tell us this is the best ROI they've seen on executive education because it prevents so many costly mistakes downstream. Would you like to see the specific ROI calculations?",

        "Budget constraints are real, and I respect that. Here's what's interesting - every executive who's completed the program tells us it was the cheapest insurance policy they ever bought against AI implementation failures. The real cost is not having a strategy."

      "objection": "Don't have time / Too busy / Schedule is packed",
      
      "primary": "I completely understand - your time is incredibly valuable, and that's exactly why our program is designed specifically for busy executives.\n\nWe offer two formats:\n• **3-day intensive option**: Get everything you need in concentrated sessions\n• **6-week program**: Spread learning across manageable time blocks\n\nMost participants say it's the best ROI on their time because every hour directly translates to better AI decisions. The time you invest now saves months of confusion and failed experiments later.\n\nWhich format sounds more feasible for your schedule?",

        "timeInvestment": "Let me put the time investment in perspective:\n\n**3-Day Intensive**: 24 hours total\n• Equivalent to 3 long board meetings\n• Results in complete AI strategy and implementation plan\n• Saves 6-12 months of internal strategy development\n\n**6-Week Program**: 2 hours twice weekly\n• Fits around your existing calendar\n• Allows time for reflection and application\n• Can pause for urgent business priorities\n\nCompare this to the time cost of failed AI initiatives - most executives spend 50+ hours dealing with AI pilot failures.",

        "efficiency": "The program is designed for maximum time efficiency:\n\n• **No theoretical fluff** - only immediately applicable frameworks\n• **Customized content** - focused on your specific situation\n• **Flexible scheduling** - we work around your availability\n• **Just-in-time delivery** - learn what you need when you need it\n\nMost executives tell us they wish they'd made this time investment sooner because it would have saved them so much time downstream.",

        "delegation": "Many executives handle the time challenge by:\n\n• **Blocking calendar time** - treating it like any strategic priority\n• **Involving their leadership team** - sharing the learning investment\n• **Scheduling around board cycles** - using natural calendar breaks\n• **Viewing it as strategy time** - replacing less valuable meetings\n\nWhat approach would work best for your situation?"

        "I hear this from every successful executive - time is the constraint. That's why we created both the intensive and extended options. The question isn't whether you have time, but whether you can afford not to have a clear AI strategy while competitors gain advantage."

Here's what I've learned from working with 100+ executives:\n\nYou don't need to be technical to lead AI successfully. In fact, the most successful AI implementations are led by business-focused executives who understand strategy and ROI.\n\nThe biggest risk isn't lack of technical knowledge - it's waiting too long while competitors gain advantage. The program is specifically designed to give you strategic confidence without technical overwhelm.\n\nWould you like to take our quick AI readiness assessment to see exactly where you stand?",

      "detailed": {

That's exactly what the program provides.",

        "competitorAdvantage": "Here's the reality about AI readiness:\n\n• **Your competitors** are likely as unprepared as you feel\n• **The winners** will be those who invest in strategic clarity now\n• **Waiting for readiness** means waiting for competitive disadvantage\n• **Strategic preparation** is more important than technical preparation\n\nThe executives who act now will have 2+ year advantages over those who wait to feel 'ready.'"

        "priorityIntegration": "Most executives handle competing priorities by:\n\n**Integration Approach:**\n• Treating AI strategy as foundational to other initiatives\n• Using AI lens to evaluate existing priorities\n• Combining AI planning with digital transformation efforts\n• Leveraging AI to accelerate other strategic goals\n\nAI strategy often enhances other priorities rather than competing with them.",
