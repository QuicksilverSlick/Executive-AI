# WebRTC Session Resumption with Conversation History Restoration

## Overview

This implementation enhances the WebRTC voice agent to properly restore conversation context when resuming sessions. When a user refreshes the page or navigates back, the voice assistant now has full context of previous conversations and can continue naturally.

## Implementation Details

### Key Features

1. **Conversation History Injection**: After a session is restored and a new WebRTC connection is established, the system injects previous conversation history into the new session using OpenAI's Realtime API best practices.

2. **Chronological Message Ordering**: Messages are sorted by timestamp and injected in the correct chronological order to maintain conversation flow.

3. **Proper Event Handling**: The system waits for the `session.created` event before injecting history, ensuring the AI model is ready to receive the context.

4. **Context Notification**: After injecting all previous messages, a system message informs the AI that this is a restored session with previous context.

### Technical Implementation

#### Main Components Modified

1. **WebRTC Main Agent** (`src/lib/voice-agent/webrtc/main.ts`):
   - Added `pendingHistoryInjection` and `isSessionCreated` flags
   - Enhanced `restoreConversationContext()` to prepare messages for injection
   - Added `injectConversationHistory()` method for async message injection
   - Updated `session.created` event handler to trigger history injection

2. **Enhanced Session Manager** (`src/lib/voice-agent/enhanced-session-manager.ts`):
   - Added chronological sorting of messages during session restoration
   - Ensures messages are provided in correct order for history injection

#### Message Injection Flow

1. **Session Restoration**: When a session is restored, messages are stored in `pendingHistoryInjection`
2. **Connection Established**: WebRTC connection is established with OpenAI
3. **Session Created Event**: OpenAI sends `session.created` event when ready
4. **History Injection**: System injects each message using `conversation.item.create` events:
   ```javascript
   {
     event_id: `history_${messageId}`,
     type: 'conversation.item.create',
     item: {
       type: 'message',
       role: 'user' | 'assistant',
       content: [{
         type: 'input_text' | 'text',
         text: messageContent
       }]
     }
   }
   ```
5. **Context Notification**: Final system message informs AI about restored context
6. **Natural Continuation**: AI can now respond with full awareness of conversation history

### Error Handling

- **Network Errors**: If history injection fails, the system logs errors but doesn't break session functionality
- **Malformed Messages**: Invalid messages are skipped during injection
- **Connection Issues**: History injection is retried on reconnection if needed
- **Graceful Degradation**: Session works normally even if history injection partially fails

### Benefits

1. **True Conversation Continuity**: AI maintains full context across page reloads/navigation
2. **Natural User Experience**: No need to repeat previous context or questions
3. **Follow-up Question Support**: AI can answer references to previous conversation parts
4. **Session Persistence**: Conversations feel seamless despite technical session boundaries

## Usage Examples

### Before Implementation
```
User: "Tell me about AI training programs"
AI: "I'd be happy to help with AI training programs..."

[User refreshes page]

User: "What about the pricing for those programs?"
AI: "I'd be happy to help, but could you clarify which programs you're referring to?"
```

### After Implementation
```
User: "Tell me about AI training programs"
AI: "I'd be happy to help with AI training programs..."

[User refreshes page - session restoration with history injection]

User: "What about the pricing for those programs?"
AI: "For the AI training programs I mentioned earlier, here are the pricing options..."
```

## Testing

To test the conversation history restoration:

1. Start a voice conversation with the AI
2. Have a few exchanges (ask questions, get responses)
3. Refresh the browser page or navigate away and back
4. Continue the conversation with follow-up questions referencing earlier topics
5. Verify the AI responds with full context awareness

## Configuration

The history injection is automatically enabled when:
- Session restoration is successful
- Previous messages exist in the session
- WebRTC connection is established
- `session.created` event is received from OpenAI

No additional configuration is required - the feature works transparently.

## Performance Considerations

- **Message Limits**: Only the last 10 conversation exchanges are restored to prevent overwhelming the AI context
- **Injection Timing**: 50ms delays between message injections ensure proper ordering
- **Memory Cleanup**: Pending history is cleared after injection to prevent memory leaks
- **Network Efficiency**: Only essential message content is transmitted, not metadata

## Error Recovery

The system includes comprehensive error handling:
- Failed injections don't prevent new conversations
- Network errors are logged and reported
- Partial injection failures are handled gracefully
- Session functionality remains intact even if history injection fails

This implementation follows OpenAI's Realtime API best practices and ensures robust, reliable conversation continuity for voice agent interactions.
