# AI Regulatory & Compliance Landscape: Executive Guide 2025-2027

## Executive Summary

The AI regulatory landscape in 2025 presents a complex patchwork of global requirements that demand executive attention. With the EU AI Act now partially in force, divergent US approaches, and China's comprehensive framework, organizations face unprecedented compliance challenges. Non-compliance risks include fines up to €35 million or 7% of global revenue, criminal liability for executives, and severe reputational damage. This guide provides actionable strategies for navigating this evolving landscape.

## Global AI Regulations Overview

### The Three Major Regulatory Philosophies
