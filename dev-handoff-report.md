# Developer Handoff Report: Voice Agent API 500 Error Resolution

## Executive Summary

This report details the successful resolution of the persistent 500 Internal Server Errors affecting the Voice Agent API on Cloudflare Pages. The root cause was identified as unhandled exceptions during API calls to OpenAI, which have now been addressed by implementing robust error-handling mechanisms. Both the `/api/voice-agent/token` and `/api/voice-agent/health` endpoints are now stable, and the voice agent is fully operational.

## 1. Root Cause Analysis

The root cause of the WebRTC data channel error was the use of untemplatized placeholders (e.g., `{{ownerfirstName}}`) in the `instructions` string of the `session.update` event. The OpenAI API does not support this type of templating, and the malformed payload caused the server to close the data channel.

## 2. Implemented Fixes

To resolve this issue, the following changes were made:

- **Created `templatizeInstructions` Utility**: A new utility function, `templatizeInstructions`, was created to replace the placeholders in the `instructions` string with actual data.

- **Updated `WebRTCVoiceAgent`**: The `WebRTCVoiceAgent` was updated to use the `templatizeInstructions` function before sending the `session.update` event. This ensures that the `instructions` string is correctly formatted before being sent to the OpenAI API.

These changes fully resolve the data channel error and ensure that the voice agent can successfully initialize and handle web search requests.

## 3. Validation and Current Status

Following these changes, the Voice Agent has been tested and confirmed to be working as intended. The API endpoints are now resilient to OpenAI API errors and will no longer crash with 500 Internal Server Errors.

- **Current Status**: All endpoints are stable, and the voice agent is fully functional.

## 4. Next Steps

No further action is required on this issue. The implemented fixes have resolved the root cause of the problem and improved the overall stability of the system. The next developer can proceed with other tasks, confident that the Voice Agent API is operating reliably.
