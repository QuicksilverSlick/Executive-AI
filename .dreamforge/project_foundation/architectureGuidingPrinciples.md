# Architecture Guiding Principles - AI Assessment Tool

## Core Principles

### 1. Vertical Slice Architecture (VSA)
- **Principle**: Organize by features, not layers
- **Implementation**: Each assessment dimension as a complete slice
- **Benefits**: Independent development, testing, and deployment

### 2. Edge-First Computing
- **Principle**: Process at the edge for minimal latency
- **Implementation**: WebAssembly scoring, edge functions
- **Benefits**: <100ms response times, reduced costs

### 3. Progressive Enhancement
- **Principle**: Core functionality works everywhere
- **Implementation**: HTML forms → JavaScript → Voice
- **Benefits**: Maximum accessibility and compatibility

### 4. Security by Design
- **Principle**: Zero-trust architecture
- **Implementation**: End-to-end encryption, ephemeral tokens
- **Benefits**: SOC 2 compliance, data protection

## Technical Guidelines

### API Design
- RESTful endpoints with GraphQL for complex queries
- Consistent error handling
- Rate limiting per endpoint
- OpenAPI documentation

### Data Management
- PostgreSQL for assessments and responses
- Redis for session state and caching
- R2/S3 for report storage
- Event streaming for analytics

### Performance Standards
- Time to Interactive: <3 seconds
- API response time: <200ms
- Report generation: <30 seconds
- Voice latency: <100ms

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: 80% coverage minimum
- Integration tests: All API endpoints
- E2E tests: Complete user journeys
- Load tests: 100K concurrent users

## Scalability Architecture
- Serverless functions for auto-scaling
- Database connection pooling
- CDN for static assets
- Queue-based processing for reports

## Monitoring Strategy
- Real User Monitoring (RUM)
- Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
- Error tracking with Sentry
- Custom business metrics dashboard

## Development Workflow
- Feature branches with PR reviews
- Automated CI/CD pipeline
- Preview deployments for testing
- Canary releases for production

## Cost Optimization
- Prompt caching for AI calls
- Edge caching for static content
- Batch processing for reports
- Scheduled scaling for peak times
