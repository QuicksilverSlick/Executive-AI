- **Social proof**: "2,847 executives completed this week"

**Question Flow Optimization:**
- **Smart branching**: Skip irrelevant questions based on industry
- **Progressive disclosure**: Start simple, increase complexity
- **Question batching**: 5-7 questions per screen maximum
- **Visual variety**: Mix multiple choice, sliders, matrices
- **Contextual help**: Inline tooltips and examples

**Mobile-First Design Requirements:**
- Touch-optimized controls (48px minimum tap targets)
- Vertical scrolling with sticky progress header
- Swipe gestures for navigation
- Offline mode with sync capabilities
- Voice input option for all text fields

**Accessibility (WCAG 3.0):**

- Screen reader optimization with ARIA labels
- High contrast mode support
- Text scaling up to 200% without horizontal scroll
- Captions for all audio/video content

### 3. AI Assistant Integration Architecture

**Recommended Approach**: Hybrid Architecture

**Primary: OpenAI Realtime API** (for voice interaction)
- WebSocket connection for <100ms latency
- 5 expressive voices (Ash, Ballad, Coral, Sage, Verse)
- Automatic interruption handling
- Function calling for dynamic questions
- Cost: $5-$200 per 1M tokens with caching

**Secondary: Anthropic Claude** (for complex reasoning)
- 200K token context window
- Superior for detailed analysis
- Batch processing for cost savings (50% discount)
- Cost: $15/$75 per 1M tokens (input/output)

**Implementation Pattern**:
```javascript
// Voice Assistant Configuration
const voiceConfig = {
  model: "gpt-4o-realtime-preview",
  voice: "sage", // Professional, neutral tone
  instructions: `You are an AI readiness expert guiding executives 
                through an assessment. Be concise, professional, and 
                encouraging. Ask clarifying questions when needed.`,
  turn_detection: {
    type: "server_vad",
    threshold: 0.5,
    silence_duration_ms: 700
  },
  tools: [
    { type: "function", name: "save_answer" },
    { type: "function", name: "get_next_question" },
    { type: "function", name: "calculate_score" }
  ]
};
```

**Conversation Flow**:
1. **Introduction Phase**: Warm greeting, explain process
2. **Assessment Phase**: Guided questions with clarifications
3. **Clarification Phase**: Deep-dive on weak areas
4. **Summary Phase**: Real-time insights and next steps

### 4. Technical Architecture
