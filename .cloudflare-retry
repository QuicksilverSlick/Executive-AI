# Cloudflare Pages Deployment Status

If you see an "internal error" during deployment, this is typically a transient issue on Cloudflare's side.

## What to do:

1. Wait 2-3 minutes for Cloudflare's systems to reset
2. The deployment will automatically retry
3. If it continues to fail, check the Cloudflare Pages dashboard for any service incidents

## Last error reference:
- Reference ID: tq47jatq3v0d68jf8rb2ukll
- This is a Cloudflare internal error, not a code issue

The build succeeded and all files were uploaded correctly. The error occurred during the final publishing step.
