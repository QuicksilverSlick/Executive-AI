# ðŸ”„ Server Restart Required

## Why Restart?

The OpenAI API key has been configured in the `.env` file, but the development server needs to be restarted to load these environment variables.

## Steps to Restart:

### 1. Stop the Current Server
Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the server is running

### 2. Start the Server Again
```bash
npm run dev
```

## What's Been Fixed:

### âœ… API Key Configuration
- Created `.env` file with your OpenAI API key
- Added multiple format variations for compatibility
- Fixed token endpoint to read from `process.env`

### âœ… Test Page Fixed
- Removed voice agent initialization that was causing errors
- Test page now focuses on API testing only
- Access at: http://localhost:4321/test-voice-search

### âœ… Voice Search Implementation
- Responses API integration complete
- Correct endpoint and model configuration
- Citation extraction implemented
- Error handling with graceful fallbacks

## After Restarting:

### 1. Test the Search API
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4321/api/voice-agent/responses-search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "Drip City Coffee Oakland"}'
```

### 2. Check Test Page
Visit: http://localhost:4321/test-voice-search
- Click any query card to test
- Watch for real search results with citations

### 3. Test Voice Agent
On the main page:
- Click the microphone icon
- Say: "Search for Drip City Coffee in Oakland"
- Listen for search results in the response

## Expected Results:

Instead of:
```json
{
  "response": "I understand you're looking for information about...",
  "error": "Unexpected end of JSON input"
}
```

You'll see:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "response": "Based on my search, Drip City Coffee is located in Oakland...",
  "searchResults": [...],
  "citations": [...]
}
```

## Verification Commands:

```bash
# Check if API key is loaded
node test-api-key-availability.js

# Test Responses API directly
node test-openai-responses-direct.js

# Run full test suite
node test-responses-api-simple.js
```

## ðŸŽ‰ Success Indicators:

1. **API calls return real search results** (not fallback messages)
2. **Citations include actual URLs** from web search
3. **Voice agent can answer current questions** with up-to-date information
4. **Test page shows search results** with proper formatting

## ðŸš¨ If Issues Persist:

1. Ensure the server was fully stopped before restarting
2. Check that `.env` file exists and contains the API key
3. Look for any error messages in the server console
4. Verify port 4321 is not being used by another process

The implementation is complete - just restart the server to activate! ðŸš€
