# Mid-Market AI Wins: Succeeding with Limited Resources

## Introduction: The Mid-Market AI Opportunity

Mid-market companies ($100M-$1B revenue) face unique challenges in AI adoption: smaller budgets than enterprises, limited technical talent, and pressure to show quick ROI. Yet 78% of organizations now use AI in at least one business function, up from 55% a year ago. This explosive growth includes many mid-market success stories that prove you don't need billions to benefit from AI.
