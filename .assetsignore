#  @file-purpose: Assets ignore configuration for Cloudflare Workers static assets binding
#  @version: 1.0.0
#  @init-author: developer-agent
#  @init-cc-sessionId: cc-unknown-20250816-384
#  @init-timestamp: 2025-08-16T11:10:00Z
#  @reasoning:
#  - **Objective:** Prevent Worker files from being served as static assets
#  - **Strategy:** Exclude worker-specific files and dynamic imports from assets binding
#  - **Outcome:** Clean separation between Worker runtime and static assets
# /

# Worker runtime files - these should not be served as static assets
_worker.js/
_worker.js/**

# Source maps - not needed in production
**/*.map

# Manifest files that are dynamically imported
**/manifest*.mjs
**/manifest*.js

# Astro internal files
_astro-internal_*

# Build artifacts that shouldn't be publicly accessible
**/*.config.js
**/*.config.mjs
