### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
The ability of computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a valuable way.

### Prompt Engineering
The art and science of crafting effective instructions for AI systems to get optimal outputs. Critical skill for executives using AI.

### Hallucination
When an AI system generates false or nonsensical information that appears plausible. A key limitation executives must understand.

### Token
The basic unit of text that LLMs process. Roughly equivalent to a word or part of a word. Important for understanding AI costs.

### Fine-tuning
Customizing a pre-trained AI model for specific tasks or industries by training it on specialized data.

### API (Application Programming Interface)
How different software systems communicate with each other. Enables AI integration into existing business tools.

### Embeddings
Mathematical representations of text that allow AI to understand meaning and context. Powers semantic search and recommendations.
